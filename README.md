**Bank Loan EDA Case Study**

Conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank loan dataset comprising 39,717 rows and 111 columns. Key steps included:

- **Data Cleaning:** Dropped columns with excessive null values, handled outliers, and converted data types.    
-**Univariate Analysis:** Visualized distributions of annual income, loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment terms.    
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:** Analyzed relationships between loan amount, interest rates, income levels, and loan statuses to identify patterns and risk factors.    

Insights revealed that higher loan amounts and interest rates are associated with charged-off loans, while income and loan terms influence installment amounts. The analysis provides actionable insights for mitigating lending risks.
